                <h2>Welcome to My Research Page</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! My name is Killwell, and I am a passionate advocate for equity and social justice, committed to advancing these principles through rigorous research and innovative education. With a decade of combined experience in industry and academia, I excel in uncovering meaningful insights from data to drive impactful community and democratic initiatives. As a creative and analytical problem-solver, I am eager to leverage my expertise to strengthen communities at local, national, and international levels.</p>

                <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Community, Cultural & Developmental Psychology from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where my dissertation, the GEMINAI Study: Identity Measures GEM Profiles Analysis Summary, delves into the nuanced profiles created from moral identity, geopolitical identity, and ethnic identity measures. This research offers valuable insights into how identity components interact and influence behavior, providing a robust framework for understanding identity in a complex world.</p>

                <p>My Master’s thesis, Growing Up YouTube: Identity Development in the Digital Age, examines the role of YouTube communities in shaping the identity development of emerging adults. By conducting both qualitative and quantitative research, I explored how parasocial relationships and online interactions influence self-perception and socialization. The findings highlight the significant impact of digital platforms on modern identity formation.</p>

                <p>In addition to my academic background, I have hands-on experience as a Freelance Research and Data Analyst, where I conducted market research and data analysis for various clients, providing actionable insights and recommendations. My experience extends to roles such as Lecturer at Leeward Community College and the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where I developed innovative instructional methods and designed comprehensive course curriculums.</p>

                <p>I have also worked as a Market Research Analyst at Quicken Loans, where I built surveys, analyzed open-ended data, and performed statistical analysis across multiple platforms. My skills include proficiency in SPSS, R, Python, Atlas.ti, NVivo, and Microsoft Excel, as well as project management, academic research, curriculum development, and statistical analysis.</p>

                <p>I am particularly drawn to Cloudburst Consulting Group due to your commitment to leveraging data for social good. The opportunity to work on projects that address pressing social issues and contribute to meaningful change resonates deeply with my professional aspirations. I am eager to bring my analytical skills, attention to detail, and passion for data-driven storytelling to your team.</p>
