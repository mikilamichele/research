            <p><h3>Introduction</h3>
Emerging adulthood, typically defined as the age range from 18 to 29 years, is a critical period for identity development (Arnett, 2000). During this stage, individuals engage in extensive exploration and solidification of various aspects of their self-concept, including geopolitical, ethnic, and moral identities. These identity domains play significant roles in shaping political attitudes and behaviors, which in turn impact societal outcomes in a multicultural world (Phinney, 1992; Schwartz et al., 2012).

            <strong>Geopolitical Identities:</strong> Civic, national, and global identities represent different levels of geopolitical identity. <br>
            Civic identity refers to one's identification with and participation in local community activities and responsibilities (Johnson et al., in press). National identity, often linked to patriotism and nationalism, involves identification with one's country and its cultural, political, and historical narratives (Schwartz et al., 2012). Global identity, on the other hand, reflects a broader identification with humanity and concerns for global issues (McFarland et al., 2012).

            <strong>Ethnic Identity:</strong> Ethnic identity involves an individual's sense of belonging to a particular ethnic group and the importance of this group membership to their overall self-concept (Phinney, 1992). Ethnic identity development is crucial during emerging adulthood as individuals navigate their cultural heritage and its integration into their broader identity.

                <strong>Moral Identity:</strong> Moral identity is defined by the extent to which being a moral person is central to an individual's self-concept. This identity domain influences ethical behavior and attitudes towards social issues (Aquino & Reed, 2002).

                <strong>Interrelationships and Political Implications:</strong> Previous research has explored these identities in isolation, but few studies have integrated them to understand their combined influence on political attitudes and behaviors. Understanding these interrelationships is critical, especially in a multicultural and politically polarized society. For example, strong national identity has been linked to more conservative political attitudes, while global identity is often associated with more liberal perspectives (Citrin et al., 1990; Schwartz et al., 2012).
