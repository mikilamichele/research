                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                
                <p>Emerging adulthood, typically defined as the age range from 18 to 29 years, is a critical period for identity development (Arnett, 2000). During this stage, individuals engage in extensive exploration and solidification of various aspects of their self-concept, including geopolitical, ethnic, and moral identities. These identity domains play significant roles in shaping political attitudes and behaviors, which in turn impact societal outcomes in a multicultural world (Phinney, 1992; Schwartz et al., 2012).</p>
                <p><strong>Geopolitical Identities:</strong> Civic, national, and global identities represent different levels of geopolitical identity. <br>
                Civic identity refers to one's identification with and participation in local community activities and responsibilities (Johnson et al., in press). National identity, often linked to patriotism and nationalism, involves identification with one's country and its cultural, political, and historical narratives (Schwartz et al., 2012). Global identity, on the other hand, reflects a broader identification with humanity and concerns for global issues (McFarland et al., 2012).</p>
                <p><strong>Ethnic Identity:</strong> Ethnic identity involves an individual's sense of belonging to a particular ethnic group and the importance of this group membership to their overall self-concept (Phinney, 1992). Ethnic identity development is crucial during emerging adulthood as individuals navigate their cultural heritage and its integration into their broader identity.</p>
                <p><strong>Moral Identity:</strong> Moral identity is defined by the extent to which being a moral person is central to an individual's self-concept. This identity domain influences ethical behavior and attitudes towards social issues (Aquino & Reed, 2002).</p>
                <p><strong>Interrelationships and Political Implications:</strong> Previous research has explored these identities in isolation, but few studies have integrated them to understand their combined influence on political attitudes and behaviors. Understanding these interrelationships is critical, especially in a multicultural and politically polarized society. For example, strong national identity has been linked to more conservative political attitudes, while global identity is often associated with more liberal perspectives (Citrin et al., 1990; Schwartz et al., 2012).</p>

                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikilamichele/research/main/info-no-borderv2.png" alt="Infographic. Civic identity sample item is My involvement in my community is an important part of my identity.National identity sample item is, I understand pretty when what being an American means to me. Global identity sample item is How close do you feel to people across the world (versus Americans or your local community. These three feed into geopolitical identity. Moral identity asks about characteristics caring, compassionate, fair, friendly, generous, helpful, hardworking, honeest, kind. Moral identity sample items are I strongly desire to have these characteristics. Having these characteristics is an important part of who I am. I am actively involved in activities that would communicate to others that I have these characteristics. Ethnic identity asked participants to self-identity in an open-ended item the ethnic group they belong to. Sample Ethnic Ideneity items include I have a strong sense of belonging to my own ethnic group. I have spent time trying to find out more about my ethnic group, such as its history, traditions, and customs. I participate in cultural practices of my own group, such as special foods, music or customs.">

            <h3>Study Objectives</h3>
            <p>This study seeks to explore the connections between GEM (Geopolitical, Ethnic, and Moral) identities and political attitudes and behaviors among emerging adults in the United States. We aim to fill existing research gaps with the following hypotheses:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Latent Profiles of GEM Identities:</strong> We expect to identify distinct latent profiles within the sample (H1).</li>
                <li><strong>Moral Identity and Exploration:</strong> Profiles with higher moral identity will likely score higher on exploration and rumination measures (H2a).</li>
                <li><strong>Global Identity and Commitment:</strong> Profiles with higher global identities are anticipated to score higher on rumination and lower on commitment measures (H2b).</li>
                <li><strong>Social Identities and Narcissism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Profiles with lower social identities (civic, American, global, and ethnic) will likely score higher on measures of narcissism (H3a).</li>
                        <li>Profiles with higher global identity will also be associated with higher narcissism scores (H3b).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Global and Civic Identity and Altruism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High global identity profiles will be linked to higher altruism (H4a).</li>
                        <li>Higher civic identity profiles will similarly be associated with higher altruism (H4b).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>National and Global Identity and Ideologies:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High national identity profiles will correlate with more conservative ideologies (H5a).</li>
                        <li>High global identity profiles will correlate with more liberal ideologies (H5b).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>By examining these hypotheses, our research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how identity domains interact and influence political attitudes and behaviors. This study will offer valuable insights for fostering positive societal outcomes in a multicultural world.</p>
