                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Emerging adulthood, typically defined as the age range from 18 to 29 years, is a critical period for identity development (Arnett, 2000). During this stage, individuals engage in extensive exploration and solidification of various aspects of their self-concept, including geopolitical, ethnic, and moral identities. These identity domains play significant roles in shaping political attitudes and behaviors, which in turn impact societal outcomes in a multicultural world (Phinney, 1992; Schwartz et al., 2012).</p>
                    <p><strong>Geopolitical Identities:</strong> Civic, national, and global identities represent different levels of geopolitical identity. <br>
                    Civic identity refers to one's identification with and participation in local community activities and responsibilities (Johnson et al., in press). National identity, often linked to patriotism and nationalism, involves identification with one's country and its cultural, political, and historical narratives (Schwartz et al., 2012). Global identity, on the other hand, reflects a broader identification with humanity and concerns for global issues (McFarland et al., 2012).</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethnic Identity:</strong> Ethnic identity involves an individual's sense of belonging to a particular ethnic group and the importance of this group membership to their overall self-concept (Phinney, 1992). Ethnic identity development is crucial during emerging adulthood as individuals navigate their cultural heritage and its integration into their broader identity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Moral Identity:</strong> Moral identity is defined by the extent to which being a moral person is central to an individual's self-concept. This identity domain influences ethical behavior and attitudes towards social issues (Aquino & Reed, 2002).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interrelationships and Political Implications:</strong> Previous research has explored these identities in isolation, but few studies have integrated them to understand their combined influence on political attitudes and behaviors. Understanding these interrelationships is critical, especially in a multicultural and politically polarized society. For example, strong national identity has been linked to more conservative political attitudes, while global identity is often associated with more liberal perspectives (Citrin et al., 1990; Schwartz et al., 2012).</p>

                    <h2>Study Objectives</h2>
                    <p>This study seeks to explore the connections between GEM (Geopolitical, Ethnic, and Moral) identities and political attitudes and behaviors among emerging adults in the United States. We aim to fill existing research gaps with the following hypotheses:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Latent Profiles of GEM Identities:</strong> We expect to identify distinct latent profiles within the sample (H1).</li>
                        <li><strong>Moral Identity and Exploration:</strong> Profiles with higher moral identity will likely score higher on exploration and rumination measures (H2a).</li>
                        <li><strong>Global Identity and Commitment:</strong> Profiles with higher global identities are anticipated to score higher on rumination and lower on commitment measures (H2b).</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Identities and Narcissism:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Profiles with lower social identities (civic, American, global, and ethnic) will likely score higher on measures of narcissism (H3a).</li>
                                <li>Profiles with higher global identity will also be associated with higher narcissism scores (H3b).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Global and Civic Identity and Altruism:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>High global identity profiles will be linked to higher altruism (H4a).</li>
                                <li>Higher civic identity profiles will similarly be associated with higher altruism (H4b).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>National and Global Identity and Ideologies:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>High national identity profiles will correlate with more conservative ideologies (H5a).</li>
                                <li>High global identity profiles will correlate with more liberal ideologies (H5b).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>By examining these hypotheses, our research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how identity domains interact and influence political attitudes and behaviors. This study will offer valuable insights for fostering positive societal outcomes in a multicultural world.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p><strong>Research Method.</strong> Emerging adults within the United States were recruited through mTurk. Participants were required to be between the ages of 18 and 35 years and living in the United States at the time of the study. The study was advertised to the mTurk population and participants were paid $2.00 US for their time. The survey took about 25-30 minutes to complete on average. Several attention screeners were used, including open-ended items, to ensure the quality of data was high and to eliminate the possibility of âbotsâ from receiving compensation for the study, as such âbotsâ will typically not be able to interpret correctly an open-ended question and will enter nonsense characters in the text box.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Participants.</strong> The sample initially included 1,007 total participants from across the United States. Thirty-four participants were removed from the data for failing to pass at least one of the four attention screener items in the online survey, and three were removed for excessive missing or incorrect data (e.g., missing most or all of an entire measure within the survey, producing a zip code outside of the U.S.) leaving a total sample size of n = 970 (M age = 28.14, SD = 4.30). Participants were between the ages of 18 and 35 years old and living in the United States (see Figure 1 for a full distribution of participantsâ ages). A little more than half were women (n = 519, 53.34%), less than half were men (n = 444, 45.63%), two identified as non-binary (0.21%), and five declined to identify (0.52%). The ethnic breakdown was as follows: Asian or Asian American participants made up 7.42% (n = 72), Black or African American participants made up 9.20% (n = 89), Hispanic or Latino participants made up 6.91% (n = 67), White or European American participants made up the majority of the sample at 71.44% (n = 693), American Indian or Native American participants made up 1.34% (n = 13), and Mixed, Biracial, or Multiethnic participants made up 3.30% (n = 32), while 0.41% (n = 4) preferred not to identify.

            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>All 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia were represented in the sample by at least one participant. The top five states participants were located in include California (n = 92, 9%), Florida (n = 82, 8%), New York (n = 68, 7%), Texas (n = 65, 7%), and Ohio (n = 50, 5%). No one state made up more than 10% of the overall sample, and participants were fairly evenly spread out throughout the nation (for a full report of participantsâ state of residence, see Table 1 below). Thirty-eight percent (n = 374) live in suburban environments, 32.27% (n = 313) in urban environments, 15.46% (n = 150) in small towns, and 13.40% (n = 130) in rural environments. Three participants (>1%) did not report on the population density of their residence.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to asking participants about the population density of where they currently live, participants were also asked about the environments in which they grew up. The majority of participants (64.85%, n = 629) currently live in the same level of population density (e.g., rural, suburban, urban, etc.) as they did while growing up, 23.51% (n = 228) have moved to a more urban environment, and 14.30% (n = 113) have moved to a more rural environment.

  <h3>Latent Profile Analysis of GEM Identities</h3>
  <p>To explore identity profiles from dimensions of geopolitical (civic, national, and global), ethnic, and moral (GEM) identities, a latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed. LPA identifies categorical profiles based on continuous indicators. The 10 indicators used were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Civic identity: exploration (CEXP), commitment (CCOM), internalization (CINT)</li>
    <li>American identity: exploration (AMEXP), commitment (AMCOM)</li>
    <li>Global identity (GLOBAL)</li>
    <li>Ethnic identity: searching (ETHSEA), commitment (ETHCOM)</li>
    <li>Moral identity: internalization (MORINT), symbolization (MORSYM)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A series of models with profiles from two to 10 were analyzed using the tidyLPA package in R. Model fit was evaluated using Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaikeâs information criterion (AIC), bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT), and entropy score.</p>
  <p>Results indicated that the five-profile solution provided the best fit based on AIC and entropy scores. Although the BIC score suggested a six-profile solution, the five-profile solution had more substantive implications, leading to its selection for analysis.</p>

  <h3>Demographic Differences in Profile Membership</h3>
  <h4>Effects of Ethnicity on Profile Membership</h4>
  <p>A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of ethnicity on profile membership for High Achievers (<i>F</i>(6, 959) = <b>5.352</b>, <i>p</i> < 0.001). A Tukey post hoc test revealed significant differences between groups. Latinos/Hispanics were more likely to be categorized as High Achievers compared to Black/African Americans (<i>p</i> = .002) and less likely compared to Native Americans (<i>p</i> <.001). No significant effects of ethnicity were found for other profiles.</p>
  
  <h4>Effects of Political District on Profile Membership</h4>
  <p>An independent samples t-test showed no significant effect of political district on profile membership.</p>
  
  <h4>Effects of Gender on Profile Membership</h4>
  <p>Males (M = 0.83, M= 0.84) were more likely than females (M = 0.76, M = 0.68) to belong in the High Achievers (<i>t</i> = <b>2.14</b>, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and Moral Civic Explorers (<i>t</i> = <b>4.06</b>, <i>p</i> < .001) profiles. No other gender effects were observed.</p>
  
  <h3>Demographic Correlates of Profile Membership</h3>
  <p>For High Achievers, no demographic variables were significantly correlated. The probability of membership in the Moderate Achievers profile was significantly correlated with currently living in a more urban environment (<i>r</i> = 0.064, <i>p</i> < .10), higher household income (<i>r</i> = 0.124, <i>p</i> < .01), and higher education (<i>r</i> = 0.111, <i>p</i> < .01). The Moral Civic Explorers profile was significantly correlated with being raised in a more rural environment (<i>r</i> = -0.093, <i>p</i> < .01), lower household income (<i>r</i> = -0.084, <i>p</i> < .01), lower levels of education (<i>r</i> = -0.112, <i>p</i> < .01), and younger age (<i>r</i> = -0.080, <i>p</i> < .01). The only significant demographic variable related to Moral Nationals was age, with older participants being more likely included in this profile (<i>r</i> = 0.080, <i>p</i> < .01). Finally, the Civic Nationals profile was significantly correlated with being raised in a more urban environment (<i>r</i> = 0.084, <i>p</i> < .01) and lower household income (<i>r</i> = -0.062, <i>p</i> < .05).</p>
  
  <h3>GEM Profiles in Relation to Measures of Individual Ego Identity Status</h3>
  <p>We compared GEM identity profiles with subscales from the DIDS (exploration in breadth, exploration in depth, ruminative exploration, commitment making, identification with commitment):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High Achievers: Higher scores in all subscales except ruminative exploration.</li>
    <li>Moderate Achievers: Higher scores in exploration in depth, commitment making, identification with commitment.</li>
    <li>Moral Civic Explorers: Higher scores in exploration in breadth, lower in exploration in depth, higher in ruminative exploration, lower in commitment making and identification with commitment.</li>
    <li>Moral Nationals: Negative association with all subscales.</li>
    <li>Civic Nationals: Negative association with all subscales except ruminative exploration.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Effects of Profile Membership</h3>
  <p><b>Exploration in Breadth:</b> High Achievers scored highest, followed by Moral Civic Explorers. Civic Nationals scored lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Exploration in Depth:</b> High Achievers scored highest, followed by Moderate Achievers. Civic Nationals scored lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Ruminative Exploration:</b> Moral Civic Explorers and Civic Nationals scored highest. Moral Nationals scored lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Commitment Making:</b> High and Moderate Achievers scored highest. Civic Nationals scored lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Identification with Commitment:</b> High and Moderate Achievers scored highest. Civic Nationals scored lowest.</p>
  <p>Overall, higher achievement in GEM identities correlated with high exploration (except ruminative) and commitment, supporting the existence of the latent profiles identified.</p>

  <h3>GEM Profiles in Relation to Narcissism</h3>
  <p><b>H3a:</b> Lower social identities with higher narcissism was not supported. Profiles with lower social identities had higher moral identities. Moral Civic Explorers and Moral Nationals had the lowest narcissism scores, suggesting moral identity might protect against narcissism.</p>
  <p><b>H3b:</b> Higher global identity with higher narcissism was partially supported. Moderate and High Achievers scored high on global identity and leadership/authority narcissism. However, Moral Civic Explorers scored high on global identity but lowest on all narcissism subscales.</p>
  
  <h3>Narcissism Subscales</h3>
  <p><b>Leadership/Authority:</b> Civic Nationals scored highest, followed by High and Moderate Achievers. Moral Civic Explorers and Moral Nationals scored lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Grandiose/Exhibitionism:</b> Civic Nationals scored highest, followed by Moderate and High Achievers. Moral Nationals and Moral Civic Explorers scored lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Entitlement/Exploitation:</b> Civic Nationals scored highest. Other profiles were equally low.</p>

  <h3>GEM Profiles in Relation to Altruism</h3>
  <p><b>H4a:</b> High global identity profiles with higher altruism was supported. High Achievers, Moderate Achievers, and Moral Civic Explorers scored highest in altruism.</p>
  <p><b>H4b:</b> Higher civic identity profiles with higher altruism was partially supported. Moral Civic Explorers scored high on altruism and civic identity, but Civic Nationals, strongly characterized by civic identity, scored low on altruism. Civic identity may relate to higher altruism when moral identity is also prioritized.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="profiles-ideology">
  <h3>GEM Profiles in Relation to Political Ideologies</h3>
  <p><b>H5a:</b> High national identity profiles with more conservative ideologies was supported. Profiles with higher national identities (Civic Nationals and Moral Nationals) scored more conservatively.</p>
  <p><b>H5b:</b> High global identity profiles with more liberal ideologies was not supported. High and Moderate Achievers, with high global identity, were moderate politically, with High Achievers slightly more liberal.</p>
  
  <h3>Political Ideologies in General</h3>
  <p>Civic Nationals were most conservative across all measures, consistent with low exploration scores and authoritarian tendencies associated with conservative ideologies. Moderate and High Achievers were more moderate, with High Achievers slightly more liberal. Moral identity drove more liberal political ideologies, with Moral Civic Explorers being the most liberal profile.</p>
</div>
      </section>
<div class="discussion">
  
    <section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>Profiles varied the most across civic identity measures, suggesting this identity may be an important (and relatively understudied) influence on self-concept and how we view ourselves in relation to society. American and Ethnic identities were the most homogenous across profiles, likely due to the predominantly White sample. All profiles scored high in moral internalization except Civic Nationals. Only High Achievers and Moderate Achievers scored high on moral symbolization.</p>
  <p>Higher internalization of identity with the community (measured through civic identity) and commitment to American identity were associated with profiles that also scored high on moral symbolization. This may suggest that increased internalization of a community-based identity may lead an individual to desire more to be assessed by others as a moral individual. Moral internalization was consistently higher compared to moral symbolization for all profiles except Civic Nationals.</p>
  
  <h3>Research Question 1: Existence of Latent Profiles Across GEM Domains</h3>
  <p>Latent profile analysis revealed a five-profile model fit the geopolitical, ethnic, and moral identity data well. These five GEM profiles correlated to measures that would be expected given their dominant domains of identity, providing support that these latent profiles were derived from a model that fits the data in a substantive way. Significant differences were found across measures of ego identity, indicating that levels of exploration and commitment toward an overall sense of individual identity are linked in meaningful ways to patterns of identity across other domains. Differential relationships between identity profiles and narcissism contribute to the current literature on narcissism in emerging adulthood by providing a more fine-grained look at how identity processes may be related to increased narcissism, and how different narcissism subscales, and ultimately different narcissism attitudes and outcomes, are related to identity in differing ways. Overall, the latent profile analysis results support the first (H1) hypothesis that different latent profiles exist within the GEM identity data.</p>
  
  <h3>Research Question 2: GEM Profiles in Relation to Ego Identity Status Measures</h3>
  <p><b>H2a:</b> There were significant differences for all ego identity measures across profiles. In partial support of hypothesis 2a, more overall identity exploration was associated with a higher likelihood of membership in a profile with high moral identity, though rumination was not associated with profiles having higher moral identity.</p>
  <p><b>H2b:</b> Moral Civic Explorers are characterized by high exploration scores in civic identity and high moral identity scores. This group scored lower on exploration measures, and higher on rumination, supporting this hypothesis.</p>
  
  <h3>Ego Identity Status Measures in General</h3>
  <p><b>Exploration in Depth:</b> Highest for both High and Moderate Achievers profiles. High Achievers have the highest scores overall across all GEM identity measures, suggesting higher exploration in depth potentially leads to greater levels of identity commitment. Civic Nationals were the lowest scoring profile for exploration in depth.</p>
  <p><b>Exploration in Breadth:</b> High Achievers scored the highest, followed closely by Moral Civic Explorers, who scored high on exploration measures of GEM identities but low on commitment. Civic Nationals scored low both on exploration in breadth and exploration in depth.</p>
  <p><b>Ruminative Exploration:</b> Moral Civic Explorers and Civic Nationals scored the highest on ruminative exploration. Along with the high exploration in breadth and low exploration in depth scores for Moral Civic Explorers, a high ruminative exploration score suggests this profile group has a varied or unfocused exploration strategy to identity development, consistent with prolonged moratorium. Ruminative exploration was lowest for Moral Nationals.</p>
  <p><b>Commitment Making:</b> Both High and Moderate Achievers scored highest on commitment making. Moral Nationals had moderately high scores on this measure. Civic Nationals scored the lowest in commitment making.</p>
  <p><b>Identification with Commitment:</b> Since commitment and exploration characterize High and Moderate Achievement, it is not surprising that these two profiles score higher for commitment making as well. Civic Nationals scored the lowest on this measure.</p>
  <p><b>Summary of Ego Identity Scales:</b> Overall, profiles characterized by higher achievement in GEM identities scored high on both exploration (except ruminative exploration) and commitment. This suggests that the latent profiles for GEM identities are consistent with ego identity indices of exploration and commitment. Consistency across these two groups of identities may demonstrate further support for the existence of the latent profiles identified in this study.</p>
  
  <h3>Research Question 3: GEM Profiles in Relation to Narcissism</h3>
  <p><b>H3a:</b> This hypothesis was not supported by the data. The profiles that tended to score lower on social identities, scored higher on moral identities. Moral Civic Explorers and Moral Nationals had the lowest scores of narcissism overall. Further research is needed to understand the interaction between moral identity and social identities. Moral identity could be a protective factor of negative effects when lacking identification with social groups. Alternatively, social group membership and identification with a social group may provide a framework for moral attitudes that is protective against traits such as narcissism in a similar fashion to moral identity.</p>
  <p><b>H3b:</b> This hypothesis was partially supported. Moderate and High Achievers scored high on the global identity measure and moderately high on the authority/leadership subscale of narcissism. However, Moral Civic Explorers also scored high on global identity but scored the lowest on all subscales of narcissism. Considering the Moral Nationals profiles scored similarly low on overall narcissism as the Moral Civic Explorers, this finding may further support the idea that moral identity may be protective against narcissism. Civic Nationals scored the highest on overall narcissism, so it is unlikely that high civic identity or high national identity were protective factors against narcissism for Moral Nationals and Moral Civic Explorers. An alternative interpretation is that moral identity is unrelated to narcissism, but that a sense of identity achievement overall is associated with higher levels of self-esteem, a trait attributed to higher leadership/authority narcissism.</p>
  
  <h3>Narcissism Subscales in General</h3>
  <p><b>Leadership/Authority Narcissism:</b> This subscale of narcissism is considered to represent an adaptive version of narcissism, focusing on skills valued by society such as leadership, assertiveness, and confidence. Civic Nationals scored the highest on this measure of narcissism (and all other narcissism measures). This was the only subscale of narcissism that High Achievers scored moderately high on, followed by Moderate Achievers. Moral Civic Explorers and Moral Nationals scored the lowest on leadership/authority narcissism and on all other measures of narcissism.</p>
  <p><b>Grandiose/Exhibitionism:</b> Civic Nationals scored the highest on this measure, followed by Moderate Achievers and then High Achievers, with Moral Nationals and Moral Civic Explorers scoring the lowest.</p>
  <p><b>Entitlement/Exploitation:</b> Once again, Civic Nationals scored the highest on this measure of narcissism. Additionally, Civic Nationals scored the lowest on measures of moral identity, which may be related to a lack of intrinsic motivation to avoid the exploitation of others and a more extreme prioritization of oneâs own desires as with entitlement. All other profiles scored equally low on this measure of narcissism.</p>
  <p><b>Overall Narcissism:</b> Overall, Civic Nationals outrank all other profiles on narcissism subscales and total narcissism. Moderate and High Achievers scored moderately on measures of narcissism, with High Achievers more likely to score high on the leadership/authority subscale, which is theorized to be an adaptive form of narcissism. Concerns over the increase in population levels of reported narcissism may be driven by two paths; higher identity achievement through greater opportunities for and cultural expectations of moratorium, and through foreclosed civic and national identities when moral identity is not included in the profiles as a dominant identity.</p>
  
  <h3>Research Question 4: GEM Profiles in Relation to Altruism</h3>
  <p><b>H4a:</b> The highest scoring profiles in altruism were High Achievers, Moderate Achievers, and Moral Civic Explorers. These were also the three profiles characterized in part by higher global identity, providing support for this hypothesis.</p>
  <p><b>H4b:</b> This hypothesis was not fully supported by the data. Moral Civic Explorers scored high on altruism and are partially characterized by high civic identity; however, the Civic Nationals profile was the most strongly characterized by high civic identity (exploration specifically, but low on civic internalization). Civic identity may be related to higher altruism, but only when moral identity is also internally prioritized.</p>
  
  <h3>Research Question 5: GEM Profiles in Relation to Political Ideologies</h3>
  <p><b>H5a:</b> This hypothesis is supported by the data in that profiles including higher national identities (e.g., Civic Nationals and Moral Nationals) scored more conservatively or moderately conservatively (respectively) on measures of political ideology.</p>
  <p><b>H5b:</b> This hypothesis was not supported by the data. The two profiles including the highest scores in global identities are High and Moderate Achievers. High Achievers were somewhat liberal overall, but moderate on social issues and neo-conservative values. Moderate Achievers were more conservative across measures.</p>
  
  <h3>Political Ideologies in General</h3>
  <p>Civic Nationals consistently scored the most conservative on all measures (social justice, core issues, social issues, neo-conservative issues, and overall political ideology). This is consistent with their low exploration scores, as individuals in a more foreclosed status are more likely to enjoy conformity and authoritarianism, which have been associated with more right-wing conservative political ideologies (Bennion & Adams, 1986; Cramer, 2000; Marcia, 1966).</p>
  <p>Moderate and High Achievers were somewhat moderate politically, with High Achievers being slightly more liberal compared to Moderate Achievers, who were more conservative on social justice issues, core issues, and social issues, but more liberal on neo-conservative values. Decision-making may take different forms for Achievers profiles, who are more likely to make decisions in a more rational and systemic way (Bluestein, Furner, & Phillips, 1990). This differential decision-making process may lead to less empathetic or compassionate responses to political ideology questions.</p>
  <p>Moral identity seemed to be a driver of more liberal political ideology, as Moral Civic Explorers were consistently the most liberal profile, and Moral Nationals scoring more liberal on most measures of ideology.</p>

      <div class="limitations">
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>The study's generalizability is limited due to the predominantly White sample from Amazonâs Mechanical Turk. Different identity domains, such as gender, sexual, vocational, and religious identities, were not included, potentially limiting the scope of findings. Future studies should explore more diverse samples and additional identity domains to understand their influence on civic attitudes and behaviors.</p>
</div>

<div class="future-directions">
  <h2>Future Directions</h2>
  <p>Future research should investigate the stability and dynamics of GEM identity profiles over time and across developmental stages. Longitudinal studies could examine how profiles change and the influence of identity domains on civic attitudes and behaviors. Understanding the interplay of identities as integrated or competing constructs is another area worth exploring.</p>
</div>

<div class="theoretical-implications">
  <h2>Theoretical Implications</h2>
  <p>This study highlights the importance of geopolitical identities and their influence on behavior and attitudes. It provides insight into how identity profiles are prioritized and their sociopolitical outcomes. The findings also contribute to understanding the relationship between identity development and narcissism in emerging adulthood.</p>
</div>

<div class="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The study identified five distinct latent profiles: High Achievers, Moderate Achievers, Moral Civic Explorers, Moral Nationals, and Civic Nationals. These profiles were significantly differentiated across ego identity, narcissism, altruism, and political ideologies, demonstrating the usefulness of latent profiles in understanding the social and political lives of emerging adults in the United States.</p>
