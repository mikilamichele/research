                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>This thesis investigates cultural values and identity formation within the YouTube community, focusing on the Holy Trinity (Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart). The mixed-methods research comprises two studies: Study 1 utilizes ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and content analysis, while Study 2 employs a quantitative survey to assess online identity, sense of community, parasocial attachment, and cultural values among 135 participants. The findings highlight the importance of community support and authenticity, the influence of self-reflection and humor, and the role of parasocial attachment in shaping online identity and community. The implications of these findings for understanding identity development and well-being among emerging adults in digital spaces are discussed.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This study explores the cultural values and identity formation within the YouTube community, specifically focusing on the Holy Trinity of YouTube—Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart. The research aims to understand how these YouTubers and their followers balance individualism and community values, authenticity, and self-expression. The significance of YouTube as a social platform where emerging adults explore and express their identities is highlighted, addressing a gap in existing literature. The research questions guiding the study focus on the cultural values present in the YouTube community and how participation in this community influences identity formation.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 2. Literature Review</h2>
                    <p>This chapter reviews existing research on identity development, cultural values, and online communities, focusing on key theories and findings relevant to the study. Erikson's (1968) theory of identity development emphasizes the importance of balancing individuality and community during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Arnett (2000) expands on this by describing emerging adulthood as a distinct developmental stage characterized by identity exploration.</p>
                    <p>Research on social media highlights its role in providing platforms for self-expression and community building. Boyd (2007) discusses how social media enables users to construct and navigate their identities online. Tufekci (2008) and Ibrahim (2009) explore how digital interactions can foster a sense of authenticity and connection among users, contributing to their identity development.</p>
                    <p>The concept of parasocial interaction, introduced by Horton and Wohl (1956), describes the one-sided relationships viewers form with media personalities. Rubin and McHugh (1987) find that such interactions can significantly impact viewers' perceptions and behaviors. More recent studies, such as those by Cole and Leets (1999), adapt this concept to online environments, showing how YouTube personalities influence their followers.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3. Study 1 Methods</h2>
            <p>Study 1 uses ethnographic methods to explore the Holy Trinity community on YouTube. This qualitative study involves participant observation of the top 60 videos, semi-structured interviews with community members, and content analysis. Field notes were taken during video observations, and interviews were conducted online. Videos were coded for thematic content and cultural values. The study captures the lived experiences and cultural practices within this YouTube community, highlighting the importance of community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor in the Holy Trinity's content.</p>

                        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> Also, I saw on Tumblr today, I don’t know who Tumblred this but you are great, that all of the subscribers have been like banding together to make sure that the movie doesn’t get pirated.<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> Oh yeah, I love that we have our own, like pirate squad!<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> Self-policing... yeah. And they’re like trying to organize like, a united
front of checking the Internet every day...<br>
<strong>Hannah:</strong> To make sure it’s not being pirated? Awe!<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> To make sure it’s not being pirated, but then also to create some sort of organizational thing where once a week they all check on one day as it grows further on...<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> It’s like um, community watch! Hannah: Yeah! Neighborhood watch! Grace: And I was like, you guys are great! Hannah: That’s amazing!

                        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> I may or may not keep this story in, but that’s like, one of my favorite stories of Mamrie is she slept over on my couch, and then the next morning<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> Oh you - [Both stop to laugh.] Oh you don’t need to say this! Grace: I won’t, I won’t say it.<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> No say it, you can say it. Grace’s house, at this time, had like, walls around rooms, but it wasn’t full walls, like the ceiling was open.<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> Yeah, you can hear everything that happens in every room. Mamrie slept over, she slept on the couch and I woke up and she was like “did you guys hear that last night?” And I was like, “what I didn’t hear anything?” And she was like, “I, farted so loud in my sleep, I woke myself up, and then just started laughing hysterically, because I realized where I was and what I had just done.”<br>

                    <div class="vignette">
                        <p>Oh it’s totally a community because everyone will just say “hi” to everyone else in the comments and you recognize people there. Like, I have so many friends on Tumblr and Twitter and Snapchat now. We all just kind of met randomly because we all like the Holy Trinity, but it’s different than being a fandom because we all kind of get to know each other, and when someone is sad, someone needs help studying for an exam or something we’re all there for them. <br><em>(Participant 013)</em></p>

                    <div class="vignette">
                        <p>I joined YouTube because I live in a really lame small town in the middle of no where, and the people around here are just kind of not my thing, you know? So I felt like the YouTube community had people who kind of get me more, and it’s true. I use YouTube to make friends and making videos is how you do that, it’s how you introduce yourself to this world and say, “hey, anyone wanna hang through the interwebs?” <br><em>(Participant 006)</em>.</p>

                        <p>A lot of people talk about YouTube being an authentic space, and maybe for the most part it is, but I think Grace, Hannah, and Mamrie are three of the most authentic individuals on the Internet. Just, because of the sheer number of people who view them they can’t actually reach out to each and every one of us but I think they really, really would if they could. They don’t make videos to promote themselves or to sell something; they make videos to make people laugh, and to celebrate friendship, and those are things you can really build a community around. It’s deeper stuff you know? I know Grace’s podcasts is called “Not Too Deep”, but I think comedy can be really deep when you do it the way they do it. They really have heart, and I think I sound like their agent now, but I really do care about their success because they are really cool people and that really comes across. It’s like we’re all really proud parents of the three of them and that’s how you make a community, right? You have families and people who are invested in the success of those families and that’s really what this community feels like. <br><em>(Participant 007)</em></p>

                        <p>I think, you know, couple years ago I think I would’ve said that it probably wasn’t the community it was just a fandom, But in the last two years I have fallen in love with a girl through the holy trinity. We noticed each other on tumbler and in the comments section and we talked for a while and we just kind, I don’t know, really really like each other. She lives on the opposite side of the country than me, and neither of us really had any money to spend and go visit each other. On top of that I was 18 and still living with my parents and I wasn’t out to them yet, so asking them for help was a total no go. The other members of the Holy Trinity Community started a Go Fund Me campaign for us, and raised $1200 for us to have a vacation and meet in person finally. I flew out to Alberta and met with her, and my whole life changed. I live there now with her, I moved out with her six months after that trip. On top of all of that, I have since come out to my family, who are pretty supportive now, but the process was really rough, and the members of the Holy Trinity community were totally there for me and my girlfriend. <br><em>(Participant 002)</em></p>

            <h2>Chapter 4. Study 1 Results</h2>
            <p>Study 1 reveals four main themes: community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor. Community support is evident in the collaborative efforts among YouTubers and their viewers, who promote each other's projects and protect their work. Authenticity is a core value, with YouTubers sharing genuine emotions and leaving in mistakes to create a sense of realness. Self-reflection is significant, as creators constantly evaluate their appearance and content. Humor, especially self-deprecating humor, helps navigate self-acceptance and audience engagement. The findings show a blend of individualistic and communitarian values, reflecting a complex identity formation process among the Holy Trinity community.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5. Study 2 Methods</h2>
            <p>Study 2 complements the qualitative findings with a quantitative survey of 135 emerging adults from the YouTube community. Participants, recruited through social media, completed a 115-item questionnaire measuring ethnic identity, global identity, online identity, sense of community on YouTube, YouTube presence, cultural values, parasocial attachment, and demographics. Data collection spanned six weeks using Qualtrics.com. The survey aimed to examine the relationships between online presence, identity, and cultural values, providing a comprehensive understanding of how participation in the YouTube community influences identity formation.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 6. Study 2 Results</h2>
            <p>The results of Study 2 indicate that increased online presence correlates with a stronger sense of community and higher online identity scores, mediated by parasocial attachment. Participants who spend more time on YouTube and have higher levels of parasocial attachment report a greater sense of belonging and community. No significant correlation was found between online presence and ethnic or global identity. Both individualistic and collectivistic values are endorsed, suggesting a balanced value system. The findings suggest that YouTube serves as a platform for individual self-expression and community building, aligning with the dual desire for autonomy and connection among emerging adults.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 7. Discussion</h2>
            <h3>Research Question 1: What Cultural Values and Practices are Present within a Particular YouTube Community?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> The Holy Trinity members and their viewers exhibit a spirit of camaraderie, promoting each other's projects and achievements without expecting direct rewards. This support extends to viewers who protect their favorite YouTubers' work from piracy and feel a personal connection to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Authenticity is highly valued, with YouTubers sharing genuine aspects of their lives, which encourages viewers to disclose personal information and strengthens the sense of community. This authenticity bridges the gap between online and offline worlds, making YouTube an integral part of users' lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> The act of creating videos requires self-reflection, balancing self-image with audience perceptions. This process helps individuals explore and solidify their identities within the community.
</li>
                <li><strong>Humor:</strong> Humor serves as a tool for self-reflection and acceptance, allowing YouTubers to address and embrace their flaws while connecting with their audience.
</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Research Question 2: Is Online Presence Within the YouTube Community Associated with an Increase in Participants’ Endorsement of Sense of Community on YouTube?</h3>
            <p>The study found that increased online presence is associated with a heightened sense of community on YouTube. However, this relationship is mediated by parasocial attachment, suggesting that the emotional connection to YouTubers plays a significant role in fostering community.
</p>
            <h3>Research Question 3: Do Group Differences for Individualistic and Collectivistic Cultural Value Endorsement Exist Between Participants Who Endorse Fame or Career Achievement as Primary Goals for Participating in the Community and Those Who Do Not Endorse These Items as Primary Motivators?
</h3>
            <p>Participants did not exhibit significant differences in endorsing individualistic versus collectivistic values. Both sets of values were highly endorsed, indicating that YouTube users balance personal aspirations with communal values. Health emerged as a highly endorsed intrinsic value, while spirituality was the least endorsed extrinsic value.
            </p>
            <h3>Research Question 4: Is Participation in the YouTube Community Associated with Identity?</h3>
            <p>While participation in YouTube is associated with higher online identity scores, this relationship is not significant when parasocial attachment is considered. Ethnic and global identities were inversely related but not associated with YouTube participation.
</p>
            <h3>Research Question 5: Is Parasocial Attachment Associated with Feelings of Community, Fame Motivation, Global, Ethnic, or Online Identity?</h3>
            <p>Parasocial attachment significantly correlates with sense of community and online identity, and the endorsement of focusing on one's own needs and desires. It does not significantly relate to fame motivation, ethnic identity, or global identity.
</p>
            <h3>Research Limitations</h3>
            <p>This study's ethnographic approach may introduce researcher bias, and its findings are not entirely generalizable due to the cultural homogeneity of participants. Future research should explore more diverse online communities and the motivations behind community participation.
</p>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>Future research should investigate the relationships between parasocial attachment, identity formation, and cultural values in online and offline contexts. Studies should include more diverse populations and examine the implications for well-being and identity development.</p>
            <h3>Implications</h3>
            <p>Understanding how cultural values and online communities shape identity can inform approaches to addressing social anxieties and mental health issues. The integration of individualistic and communitarian values in online spaces like YouTube may offer protective factors for the well-being of emerging adults.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This study highlights the complex interplay between individualistic and communitarian values within the YouTube community around The Holy Trinity. Emerging adults in this community navigate their identities through self-expression, community support, and parasocial attachment. These findings suggest that online spaces can provide a unique environment for identity formation, as seen in this specific group, balancing autonomy and community in ways that reflect broader cultural shifts.</p>
