                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>This thesis explores the impact of online social interactions on the identity formation and cultural values of emerging adults within the YouTube community, specifically focusing on the Holy Trinity (Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart). The research employs a mixed-methods approach, consisting of two studies. Study 1 involves ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and content analysis to investigate cultural values and identity themes within a self-defined YouTube community. Study 2 uses an online survey with 135 participants to measure aspects of online identity, sense of community, parasocial attachment, and cultural values. The findings suggest a blend of individualistic and collectivistic values, with a preference for communitarian values driven by individualistic motivations. Key themes include the significance of community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor in shaping online identity and community. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the identity development and well-being of emerging adults in digital spaces.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>As young children, our caretakers impart ways of being that are deeply tied to the communities in which they were raised. Our cultural identities and values evolve dynamically as we interact with our environment and the mesh of cultures around us (Greenfield, 2009). Today's emerging adults, often called "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001), grow up in a rapidly shifting social environment dominated by the Internet and technology for social interaction (boyd, 2007). These young adults face the challenge of exploring and solidifying their individuated identity within their present culture, primarily through online communities on social media platforms (Arnett, 2000; Erikson, 1968).</p>

                    <p>The increasing mediation of socialization by technology has shifted much of young people's interactions to online spaces like MySpace, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (boyd & Ellison, 2007). These platforms have largely replaced face-to-face interactions, influencing how emerging adults identify with cultural values (Jensen & Arnett, 2012). One prominent way individuals express identity online is by creating and posting videos on YouTube, which has evolved into a social space with its own brand of celebrities. The Holy Trinity—Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart—represent a unique YouTube community where followers often transition from online interactions to real-life friendships, providing a rich context to study the transfer of cultural values.</p>

                    <p>This thesis aims to understand how online social settings impact identity and cultural values in emerging adults. It explores cultural values and practices in video content, motivations for community participation, sense of belonging, and parasocial attachment. Study 1 provides an ethnographic account of a self-defined YouTube community, while Study 2 uses an online survey to examine relationships between online presence, identity, and cultural values. The findings highlight the influence of community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor in shaping online identity and community. This research offers insights into the socialization processes of digital natives and the implications of their online interactions for identity development and well-being.</p></div>

                    <h2>Chapter 2. Literature Review</h2>
                    <h3>Social Change and Human Development</h3>
                    <p>Patricia Greenfield’s (2009) theory of social change and human development emphasizes that as communities evolve, so do cultural values and learning environments. With urbanization, technological advancements, and improved education, individualistic values increase. This model, rooted in Ferdinand Tönnies' (1912) dichotomy of Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society), illustrates how localized, collectivistic values give way to global, individualistic ones as societies become more industrialized. The Internet, as a global society, reflects this trend towards individualism. Fame, a highly individualistic value, has grown in prominence, particularly among youth influenced by television, YouTube, and other media (Uhls & Greenfield, 2011, 2012). Fame is now seen as an achievable goal through platforms like YouTube, making it a critical value in understanding online communities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Emerging Adulthood and Identity Formation</h3>
                    <p>Emerging adulthood, defined as ages 18-29, extends the identity exploration traditionally associated with adolescence (Arnett, 2000). This stage involves evaluating personal values and belief systems within a broader cultural context (Erikson, 1968). Identity formation is influenced by social interactions, which today are increasingly mediated by online platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (Jensen & Arnett, 2012). These platforms expose emerging adults to diverse cultural values and identities, allowing them to experiment with different "possible selves" (Arnett, Ramos, & Jensen, 2001). The shift towards more individualistic, preference-based cultural values in Western societies (Furlong & Cartmel, 1997) means that emerging adults often seek online communities for support in identity formation (Côté & Levine, 2002).

            <h3>YouTube and Parasocial Relationships</h3>
            <p>YouTube, now the third most visited site globally (Alexa, 2014), has evolved from a video-sharing platform to a social space where users create and share personal content. This shift has implications for identity formation among emerging adults, who often develop parasocial relationships with YouTubers. These one-sided relationships, similar to those with television celebrities, can influence viewers' values and behaviors (Horton & Wohl, 1956; Greenwood, 2013). Unlike traditional media, YouTube allows for potential reciprocation, making parasocial relationships more dynamic. The intimate nature of vlogging, where content creators speak directly to the camera, enhances this connection (Wesch, 2009). Understanding these interactions is crucial for comprehending how emerging adults navigate their identities in a digital age dominated by social media.

            <h2>Chapter 3. Study 1 Methods</h2>
            <h3>Research Plan Overview</h3>
            <p>This research consists of two studies: a qualitative study (Study 1) and a quantitative study (Study 2). Study 1 involves participant observation, interviews, and content analysis, while Study 2, discussed in Chapter 5, employs online surveys. Data collection occurred from December 2014 to February 2015, following UH IRB approval.
            </p>
            <h3>Study 1 Design</h3>
            <p>Study 1 used ethnographic methods to examine cultural themes and activities in the Holy Trinity YouTube community. This involved observing the top 60 most viewed videos from the three members of the Holy Trinity, taking field notes, and coding the videos for thematic content and cultural values. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted with community members to elaborate on trends and validate preliminary findings. The ethnographic approach was chosen to explore the dynamic identity formation processes in a digital space where participants intentionally broadcast themselves.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
            <p>The top 20 videos from each Holy Trinity member were selected based on view count, as these are likely to have greater cultural influence. Field notes documented critical observations and personal reactions. Videos were coded for thematic content and cultural values. Interviews were conducted via Google Hangouts or Skype with participants who regularly upload videos and consider themselves part of the Holy Trinity community. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using ATLAS.ti software to identify themes, activities, and settings. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize participant characteristics and the frequency of themes and values.

<strong>Mamrie:</strong> Oh yeah, I love that we have our own, like pirate squad!<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> Self-policing... yeah. And they’re like trying to organize like, a united

<strong>Hannah:</strong> To make sure it’s not being pirated? Awe!<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> To make sure it’s not being pirated, but then also to create some sort of organizational thing where once a week they all check on one day as it grows further on...<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> It’s like um, community watch! Hannah: Yeah! Neighborhood watch! Grace: And I was like, you guys are great! Hannah: That’s amazing!

<strong>Mamrie:</strong> Oh you - [Both stop to laugh.] Oh you don’t need to say this! Grace: I won’t, I won’t say it.<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> No say it, you can say it. Grace’s house, at this time, had like, walls around rooms, but it wasn’t full walls, like the ceiling was open.<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> Yeah, you can hear everything that happens in every room. Mamrie slept over, she slept on the couch and I woke up and she was like “did you guys hear that last night?” And I was like, “what I didn’t hear anything?” And she was like, “I, farted so loud in my sleep, I woke myself up, and then just started laughing hysterically, because I realized where I was and what I had just done.”<br>

                        <p>Oh it’s totally a community because everyone will just say “hi” to everyone else in the comments and you recognize people there. Like, I have so many friends on Tumblr and Twitter and Snapchat now. We all just kind of met randomly because we all like the Holy Trinity, but it’s different than being a fandom because we all kind of get to know each other, and when someone is sad, someone needs help studying for an exam or something we’re all there for them. <br><em>(Participant 013)</em></p>

                        <p>I joined YouTube because I live in a really lame small town in the middle of no where, and the people around here are just kind of not my thing, you know? So I felt like the YouTube community had people who kind of get me more, and it’s true. I use YouTube to make friends and making videos is how you do that, it’s how you introduce yourself to this world and say, “hey, anyone wanna hang through the interwebs?” <br><em>(Participant 006)</em>.</p>

                        <p>A lot of people talk about YouTube being an authentic space, and maybe for the most part it is, but I think Grace, Hannah, and Mamrie are three of the most authentic individuals on the Internet. Just, because of the sheer number of people who view them they can’t actually reach out to each and every one of us but I think they really, really would if they could. They don’t make videos to promote themselves or to sell something; they make videos to make people laugh, and to celebrate friendship, and those are things you can really build a community around. It’s deeper stuff you know? I know Grace’s podcasts is called “Not Too Deep”, but I think comedy can be really deep when you do it the way they do it. They really have heart, and I think I sound like their agent now, but I really do care about their success because they are really cool people and that really comes across. It’s like we’re all really proud parents of the three of them and that’s how you make a community, right? You have families and people who are invested in the success of those families and that’s really what this community feels like. <br><em>(Participant 007)</em></p>

                        <p>I think, you know, couple years ago I think I would’ve said that it probably wasn’t the community it was just a fandom, But in the last two years I have fallen in love with a girl through the holy trinity. We noticed each other on tumbler and in the comments section and we talked for a while and we just kind, I don’t know, really really like each other. She lives on the opposite side of the country than me, and neither of us really had any money to spend and go visit each other. On top of that I was 18 and still living with my parents and I wasn’t out to them yet, so asking them for help was a total no go. The other members of the Holy Trinity Community started a Go Fund Me campaign for us, and raised $1200 for us to have a vacation and meet in person finally. I flew out to Alberta and met with her, and my whole life changed. I live there now with her, I moved out with her six months after that trip. On top of all of that, I have since come out to my family, who are pretty supportive now, but the process was really rough, and the members of the Holy Trinity community were totally there for me and my girlfriend. <br><em>(Participant 002)</em></p>

    <h2>Chapter 3. Findings from Study 1: Ethnographic Analysis</h2>
    
    <h3>Field Site and YouTube Personalities</h3>
    <p>This study focuses on the Holy Trinity community on YouTube, comprised of three prominent YouTubers: Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart. Each has built a significant following through distinctive content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grace Helbig</strong>: Known for her humorous vlogs and performance-based videos, she left My Damn Channel to gain creative control, which she announces in her popular video, "Welcome to It'sGrace".</li>
        <li><strong>Hannah Hart</strong>: Gained fame with her series "My Drunk Kitchen," where she cooks while intoxicated. She also promotes charity work through her "Have a Hart" day organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Mamrie Hart</strong>: Creates comedic mixology videos featuring pop culture references and sexual innuendo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Emergent Themes</h3>
    <h4>Community Support</h4>
    <p>The Holy Trinity community demonstrates strong support among its members. In "Welcome to It'sGrace," Grace expresses gratitude for the community's support during her transition to a new channel, highlighting the collaborative nature of YouTube. In "6 S'More Days," viewers and fellow YouTubers help Hannah Hart reach one million subscribers, illustrating the value placed on mutual support within the community.</p>

    <h4>Authenticity</h4>
    <p>Authenticity is a key theme, where YouTubers often share genuine emotions and leave in mistakes, creating a sense of realness. For example, Grace Helbig’s videos frequently include unedited speech errors and candid moments. Videos like "Grace and Mamrie Answer Your Questions" and "REVIEWING TROYE SIVAN'S HAPPY LITTLE PILL" show the trio engaging in unscripted, candid conversations, further emphasizing authenticity.</p>

    <h4>Profanity and Sexual Language</h4>
    <p>The use of profanity and sexually explicit language is common, serving as a form of self-expression and breaking social norms. This is seen as part of the YouTubers' authentic selves, making their content relatable and engaging.</p>

    <h4>Self-Reflection and Criticism</h4>
    <p>Self-reflection is frequently demonstrated through self-deprecating humor and critical comments about their appearance or content. This adds to the authenticity and relatability of their videos. The YouTubers often discuss their own processes and the challenges of creating content, inviting viewers into their creative journey.</p>

    <h3>Interview Findings</h3>
    <h4>Motivations for Creating Videos</h4>
    <p>Participants cited self-expression and socialization as primary reasons for creating videos. They appreciate the platform for allowing them to express their creativity and connect with others. Many participants felt YouTube was a safe space to share their thoughts without fear of judgment from close friends or family.</p>

    <h4>Audience Perception</h4>
    <p>Initially, many participants envisioned their audience as a single person or a close friend to ease the anxiety of speaking to an unknown audience. Over time, they developed their own "voice" and became more comfortable with their audience.</p>

    <h4>Community and Social Norms</h4>
    <p>All participants viewed the Holy Trinity fandom as a community, noting values of kindness, authenticity, and self-acceptance. The community is seen as supportive and inclusive, with a focus on being genuine and not taking oneself too seriously.</p>

    <h4>Pressure to Create Content</h4>
    <p>Some participants felt pressure to create content, especially as their subscriber count grew. This pressure was linked to a sense of responsibility to their audience and the desire to maintain engagement.</p>

    <h3>Content Analysis Results</h3>
    <p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for the thematic categories, activity settings, and the 17 cultural values from the Kasser and Ryan Aspiration Index (Kasser & Ryan, 1996), for all 60 videos. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa and was found to have strong reliability (between .821-1.00) for all three coding schemes.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4. Study 1 Results</h2>
            <p>Study 1 reveals four main themes: community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor. Community support is evident in the collaborative efforts among YouTubers and their viewers, who promote each other's projects and protect their work. Authenticity is a core value, with YouTubers sharing genuine emotions and leaving in mistakes to create a sense of realness. Self-reflection is significant, as creators constantly evaluate their appearance and content. Humor, especially self-deprecating humor, helps navigate self-acceptance and audience engagement. The findings show a blend of individualistic and communitarian values, reflecting a complex identity formation process among the Holy Trinity community.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5. Study 2 Methods</h2>
            <p>Study 2 complements the qualitative findings with a quantitative survey of 135 emerging adults from the YouTube community. Participants, recruited through social media, completed a 115-item questionnaire measuring ethnic identity, global identity, online identity, sense of community on YouTube, YouTube presence, cultural values, parasocial attachment, and demographics. Data collection spanned six weeks using Qualtrics.com. The survey aimed to examine the relationships between online presence, identity, and cultural values, providing a comprehensive understanding of how participation in the YouTube community influences identity formation.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 6. Study 2 Results</h2>
            <p>The results of Study 2 indicate that increased online presence correlates with a stronger sense of community and higher online identity scores, mediated by parasocial attachment. Participants who spend more time on YouTube and have higher levels of parasocial attachment report a greater sense of belonging and community. No significant correlation was found between online presence and ethnic or global identity. Both individualistic and collectivistic values are endorsed, suggesting a balanced value system. The findings suggest that YouTube serves as a platform for individual self-expression and community building, aligning with the dual desire for autonomy and connection among emerging adults.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 7. Discussion</h2>
            <h3>Research Question 1: What Cultural Values and Practices are Present within a Particular YouTube Community?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> The Holy Trinity members and their viewers exhibit a spirit of camaraderie, promoting each other's projects and achievements without expecting direct rewards. This support extends to viewers who protect their favorite YouTubers' work from piracy and feel a personal connection to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Authenticity is highly valued, with YouTubers sharing genuine aspects of their lives, which encourages viewers to disclose personal information and strengthens the sense of community. This authenticity bridges the gap between online and offline worlds, making YouTube an integral part of users' lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> The act of creating videos requires self-reflection, balancing self-image with audience perceptions. This process helps individuals explore and solidify their identities within the community.
</li>
                <li><strong>Humor:</strong> Humor serves as a tool for self-reflection and acceptance, allowing YouTubers to address and embrace their flaws while connecting with their audience.
</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Research Question 2: Is Online Presence Within the YouTube Community Associated with an Increase in Participants’ Endorsement of Sense of Community on YouTube?</h3>
            <p>The study found that increased online presence is associated with a heightened sense of community on YouTube. However, this relationship is mediated by parasocial attachment, suggesting that the emotional connection to YouTubers plays a significant role in fostering community.
</p>
            <h3>Research Question 3: Do Group Differences for Individualistic and Collectivistic Cultural Value Endorsement Exist Between Participants Who Endorse Fame or Career Achievement as Primary Goals for Participating in the Community and Those Who Do Not Endorse These Items as Primary Motivators?
</h3>
            <p>Participants did not exhibit significant differences in endorsing individualistic versus collectivistic values. Both sets of values were highly endorsed, indicating that YouTube users balance personal aspirations with communal values. Health emerged as a highly endorsed intrinsic value, while spirituality was the least endorsed extrinsic value.
            </p>
            <h3>Research Question 4: Is Participation in the YouTube Community Associated with Identity?</h3>
            <p>While participation in YouTube is associated with higher online identity scores, this relationship is not significant when parasocial attachment is considered. Ethnic and global identities were inversely related but not associated with YouTube participation.
</p>
            <h3>Research Question 5: Is Parasocial Attachment Associated with Feelings of Community, Fame Motivation, Global, Ethnic, or Online Identity?</h3>
            <p>Parasocial attachment significantly correlates with sense of community and online identity, and the endorsement of focusing on one's own needs and desires. It does not significantly relate to fame motivation, ethnic identity, or global identity.
</p>
            <h3>Research Limitations</h3>
            <p>This study's ethnographic approach may introduce researcher bias, and its findings are not entirely generalizable due to the cultural homogeneity of participants. Future research should explore more diverse online communities and the motivations behind community participation.
</p>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>Future research should investigate the relationships between parasocial attachment, identity formation, and cultural values in online and offline contexts. Studies should include more diverse populations and examine the implications for well-being and identity development.</p>
            <h3>Implications</h3>
            <p>Understanding how cultural values and online communities shape identity can inform approaches to addressing social anxieties and mental health issues. The integration of individualistic and communitarian values in online spaces like YouTube may offer protective factors for the well-being of emerging adults.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This study highlights the complex interplay between individualistic and communitarian values within the YouTube community around The Holy Trinity. Emerging adults in this community navigate their identities through self-expression, community support, and parasocial attachment. These findings suggest that online spaces can provide a unique environment for identity formation, as seen in this specific group, balancing autonomy and community in ways that reflect broader cultural shifts.</p>
