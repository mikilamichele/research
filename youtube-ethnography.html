                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>This thesis investigates cultural values and identity formation within the YouTube community, focusing on the Holy Trinity (Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart). The mixed-methods research comprises two studies: Study 1 utilizes ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and content analysis, while Study 2 employs a quantitative survey to assess online identity, sense of community, parasocial attachment, and cultural values among 135 participants. The findings highlight the importance of community support and authenticity, the influence of self-reflection and humor, and the role of parasocial attachment in shaping online identity and community. The implications of these findings for understanding identity development and well-being among emerging adults in digital spaces are discussed.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This study explores the cultural values and identity formation within the YouTube community, specifically focusing on the Holy Trinity of YouTube—Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart. The research aims to understand how these YouTubers and their followers balance individualism and community values, authenticity, and self-expression. The significance of YouTube as a social platform where emerging adults explore and express their identities is highlighted, addressing a gap in existing literature. The research questions guiding the study focus on the cultural values present in the YouTube community and how participation in this community influences identity formation.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 2. Literature Review</h2>
                    <p>This chapter reviews existing research on identity development, cultural values, and online communities, focusing on key theories and findings relevant to the study. Erikson's (1968) theory of identity development emphasizes the importance of balancing individuality and community during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Arnett (2000) expands on this by describing emerging adulthood as a distinct developmental stage characterized by identity exploration.</p>
                    <p>Research on social media highlights its role in providing platforms for self-expression and community building. Boyd (2007) discusses how social media enables users to construct and navigate their identities online. Tufekci (2008) and Ibrahim (2009) explore how digital interactions can foster a sense of authenticity and connection among users, contributing to their identity development.</p>
                    <p>The concept of parasocial interaction, introduced by Horton and Wohl (1956), describes the one-sided relationships viewers form with media personalities. Rubin and McHugh (1987) find that such interactions can significantly impact viewers' perceptions and behaviors. More recent studies, such as those by Cole and Leets (1999), adapt this concept to online environments, showing how YouTube personalities influence their followers.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3. Study 1 Methods</h2>
            <p>Study 1 uses ethnographic methods to explore the Holy Trinity community on YouTube. This qualitative study involves participant observation of the top 60 videos, semi-structured interviews with community members, and content analysis. Field notes were taken during video observations, and interviews were conducted online. Videos were coded for thematic content and cultural values. The study captures the lived experiences and cultural practices within this YouTube community, highlighting the importance of community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor in the Holy Trinity's content.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4. Study 1 Results</h2>
            <p>Study 1 reveals four main themes: community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor. Community support is evident in the collaborative efforts among YouTubers and their viewers, who promote each other's projects and protect their work. Authenticity is a core value, with YouTubers sharing genuine emotions and leaving in mistakes to create a sense of realness. Self-reflection is significant, as creators constantly evaluate their appearance and content. Humor, especially self-deprecating humor, helps navigate self-acceptance and audience engagement. The findings show a blend of individualistic and communitarian values, reflecting a complex identity formation process among the Holy Trinity community.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5. Study 2 Methods</h2>
            <p>Study 2 complements the qualitative findings with a quantitative survey of 135 emerging adults from the YouTube community. Participants, recruited through social media, completed a 115-item questionnaire measuring ethnic identity, global identity, online identity, sense of community on YouTube, YouTube presence, cultural values, parasocial attachment, and demographics. Data collection spanned six weeks using Qualtrics.com. The survey aimed to examine the relationships between online presence, identity, and cultural values, providing a comprehensive understanding of how participation in the YouTube community influences identity formation.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 6. Study 2 Results</h2>
            <p>The results of Study 2 indicate that increased online presence correlates with a stronger sense of community and higher online identity scores, mediated by parasocial attachment. Participants who spend more time on YouTube and have higher levels of parasocial attachment report a greater sense of belonging and community. No significant correlation was found between online presence and ethnic or global identity. Both individualistic and collectivistic values are endorsed, suggesting a balanced value system. The findings suggest that YouTube serves as a platform for individual self-expression and community building, aligning with the dual desire for autonomy and connection among emerging adults.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> YouTubers and viewers support each other’s projects, promoting a sense of camaraderie.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Genuine self-disclosure strengthens community bonds and integrates online and offline lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Creating videos fosters self-reflection and identity exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Humor:</strong> Self-deprecating humor aids in self-acceptance and connects with the audience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Research Question 2: Online Presence and Sense of Community</h3>
            <p>Increased online presence correlates with a stronger sense of community, mediated by parasocial attachment.</p>
            <h3>Research Question 3: Individualistic vs. Collectivistic Values</h3>
            <p>Participants endorse both individualistic and collectivistic values, indicating a balance of personal aspirations and communal values.</p>
            <h3>Research Question 4: Participation and Identity</h3>
            <p>More time on YouTube relates to higher online identity scores, mediated by parasocial attachment. Ethnic and global identities show no significant correlation.</p>
            <h3>Research Question 5: Parasocial Attachment</h3>
            <p>Parasocial attachment is linked to a sense of community, online identity, and self-focused cultural values but not to fame motivation or ethnic/global identity.</p>
            <h3>Research Limitations</h3>
            <p>Ethnographic bias and cultural homogeneity limit generalizability. Future studies should include diverse communities and explore motivations behind online participation.</p>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>Research should further investigate parasocial attachment, identity formation, and cultural values in diverse populations and online/offline contexts.</p>
            <h3>Implications</h3>
            <p>Understanding online cultural values and identity formation can inform approaches to addressing social anxieties and mental health issues. Online communities may provide protective factors for well-being among emerging adults.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>YouTube fosters a unique balance of individualistic and communal values, aiding identity formation and well-being in emerging adults. The platform enables users to navigate their identities through self-expression, community support, and parasocial attachment. Future research should explore these dynamics in more diverse populations.</p>
