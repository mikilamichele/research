                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>This thesis explores the impact of online social interactions on the identity formation and cultural values of emerging adults within the YouTube community, specifically focusing on the Holy Trinity (Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart). The research employs a mixed-methods approach, consisting of two studies. Study 1 involves ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and content analysis to investigate cultural values and identity themes within a self-defined YouTube community. Study 2 uses an online survey with 135 participants to measure aspects of online identity, sense of community, parasocial attachment, and cultural values. The findings suggest a blend of individualistic and collectivistic values, with a preference for communitarian values driven by individualistic motivations. Key themes include the significance of community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor in shaping online identity and community. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the identity development and well-being of emerging adults in digital spaces.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>As young children, our caretakers impart ways of being that are deeply tied to the communities in which they were raised. Our cultural identities and values evolve dynamically as we interact with our environment and the mesh of cultures around us (Greenfield, 2009). Today's emerging adults, often called "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001), grow up in a rapidly shifting social environment dominated by the Internet and technology for social interaction (boyd, 2007). These young adults face the challenge of exploring and solidifying their individuated identity within their present culture, primarily through online communities on social media platforms (Arnett, 2000; Erikson, 1968).</p>

                    <p>The increasing mediation of socialization by technology has shifted much of young people's interactions to online spaces like MySpace, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (boyd & Ellison, 2007). These platforms have largely replaced face-to-face interactions, influencing how emerging adults identify with cultural values (Jensen & Arnett, 2012). One prominent way individuals express identity online is by creating and posting videos on YouTube, which has evolved into a social space with its own brand of celebrities. The Holy Trinity—Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart—represent a unique YouTube community where followers often transition from online interactions to real-life friendships, providing a rich context to study the transfer of cultural values.</p>

                    <p>This thesis aims to understand how online social settings impact identity and cultural values in emerging adults. It explores cultural values and practices in video content, motivations for community participation, sense of belonging, and parasocial attachment. Study 1 provides an ethnographic account of a self-defined YouTube community, while Study 2 uses an online survey to examine relationships between online presence, identity, and cultural values. The findings highlight the influence of community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and humor in shaping online identity and community. This research offers insights into the socialization processes of digital natives and the implications of their online interactions for identity development and well-being.</p></div>

                    <h2>Chapter 2. Literature Review</h2>
                    <h3>Social Change and Human Development</h3>
                    <p>Patricia Greenfield’s (2009) theory of social change and human development emphasizes that as communities evolve, so do cultural values and learning environments. With urbanization, technological advancements, and improved education, individualistic values increase. This model, rooted in Ferdinand Tönnies' (1912) dichotomy of Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society), illustrates how localized, collectivistic values give way to global, individualistic ones as societies become more industrialized. The Internet, as a global society, reflects this trend towards individualism. Fame, a highly individualistic value, has grown in prominence, particularly among youth influenced by television, YouTube, and other media (Uhls & Greenfield, 2011, 2012). Fame is now seen as an achievable goal through platforms like YouTube, making it a critical value in understanding online communities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Emerging Adulthood and Identity Formation</h3>
                    <p>Emerging adulthood, defined as ages 18-29, extends the identity exploration traditionally associated with adolescence (Arnett, 2000). This stage involves evaluating personal values and belief systems within a broader cultural context (Erikson, 1968). Identity formation is influenced by social interactions, which today are increasingly mediated by online platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (Jensen & Arnett, 2012). These platforms expose emerging adults to diverse cultural values and identities, allowing them to experiment with different "possible selves" (Arnett, Ramos, & Jensen, 2001). The shift towards more individualistic, preference-based cultural values in Western societies (Furlong & Cartmel, 1997) means that emerging adults often seek online communities for support in identity formation (Côté & Levine, 2002).

            <h3>YouTube and Parasocial Relationships</h3>
            <p>YouTube, now the third most visited site globally (Alexa, 2014), has evolved from a video-sharing platform to a social space where users create and share personal content. This shift has implications for identity formation among emerging adults, who often develop parasocial relationships with YouTubers. These one-sided relationships, similar to those with television celebrities, can influence viewers' values and behaviors (Horton & Wohl, 1956; Greenwood, 2013). Unlike traditional media, YouTube allows for potential reciprocation, making parasocial relationships more dynamic. The intimate nature of vlogging, where content creators speak directly to the camera, enhances this connection (Wesch, 2009). Understanding these interactions is crucial for comprehending how emerging adults navigate their identities in a digital age dominated by social media.

            <h2>Chapter 3. Study 1 Methods</h2>
            <h3>Research Plan Overview</h3>
            <p>This research consists of two studies: a qualitative study (Study 1) and a quantitative study (Study 2). Study 1 involves participant observation, interviews, and content analysis, while Study 2, discussed in Chapter 5, employs online surveys. Data collection occurred from December 2014 to February 2015, following UH IRB approval.
            </p>
            <h3>Study 1 Design</h3>
            <p>Study 1 used ethnographic methods to examine cultural themes and activities in the Holy Trinity YouTube community. This involved observing the top 60 most viewed videos from the three members of the Holy Trinity, taking field notes, and coding the videos for thematic content and cultural values. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted with community members to elaborate on trends and validate preliminary findings. The ethnographic approach was chosen to explore the dynamic identity formation processes in a digital space where participants intentionally broadcast themselves.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
            <p>The top 20 videos from each Holy Trinity member were selected based on view count, as these are likely to have greater cultural influence. Field notes documented critical observations and personal reactions. Videos were coded for thematic content and cultural values. Interviews were conducted via Google Hangouts or Skype with participants who regularly upload videos and consider themselves part of the Holy Trinity community. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using ATLAS.ti software to identify themes, activities, and settings. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize participant characteristics and the frequency of themes and values.

<strong>Mamrie:</strong> Oh yeah, I love that we have our own, like pirate squad!<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> Self-policing... yeah. And they’re like trying to organize like, a united

<strong>Hannah:</strong> To make sure it’s not being pirated? Awe!<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> To make sure it’s not being pirated, but then also to create some sort of organizational thing where once a week they all check on one day as it grows further on...<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> It’s like um, community watch! Hannah: Yeah! Neighborhood watch! Grace: And I was like, you guys are great! Hannah: That’s amazing!

<strong>Mamrie:</strong> Oh you - [Both stop to laugh.] Oh you don’t need to say this! Grace: I won’t, I won’t say it.<br>
<strong>Mamrie:</strong> No say it, you can say it. Grace’s house, at this time, had like, walls around rooms, but it wasn’t full walls, like the ceiling was open.<br>
<strong>Grace:</strong> Yeah, you can hear everything that happens in every room. Mamrie slept over, she slept on the couch and I woke up and she was like “did you guys hear that last night?” And I was like, “what I didn’t hear anything?” And she was like, “I, farted so loud in my sleep, I woke myself up, and then just started laughing hysterically, because I realized where I was and what I had just done.”<br>

                        <p>Oh it’s totally a community because everyone will just say “hi” to everyone else in the comments and you recognize people there. Like, I have so many friends on Tumblr and Twitter and Snapchat now. We all just kind of met randomly because we all like the Holy Trinity, but it’s different than being a fandom because we all kind of get to know each other, and when someone is sad, someone needs help studying for an exam or something we’re all there for them. <br><em>(Participant 013)</em></p>

                        <p>I joined YouTube because I live in a really lame small town in the middle of no where, and the people around here are just kind of not my thing, you know? So I felt like the YouTube community had people who kind of get me more, and it’s true. I use YouTube to make friends and making videos is how you do that, it’s how you introduce yourself to this world and say, “hey, anyone wanna hang through the interwebs?” <br><em>(Participant 006)</em>.</p>

                        <p>A lot of people talk about YouTube being an authentic space, and maybe for the most part it is, but I think Grace, Hannah, and Mamrie are three of the most authentic individuals on the Internet. Just, because of the sheer number of people who view them they can’t actually reach out to each and every one of us but I think they really, really would if they could. They don’t make videos to promote themselves or to sell something; they make videos to make people laugh, and to celebrate friendship, and those are things you can really build a community around. It’s deeper stuff you know? I know Grace’s podcasts is called “Not Too Deep”, but I think comedy can be really deep when you do it the way they do it. They really have heart, and I think I sound like their agent now, but I really do care about their success because they are really cool people and that really comes across. It’s like we’re all really proud parents of the three of them and that’s how you make a community, right? You have families and people who are invested in the success of those families and that’s really what this community feels like. <br><em>(Participant 007)</em></p>

                        <p>I think, you know, couple years ago I think I would’ve said that it probably wasn’t the community it was just a fandom, But in the last two years I have fallen in love with a girl through the holy trinity. We noticed each other on tumbler and in the comments section and we talked for a while and we just kind, I don’t know, really really like each other. She lives on the opposite side of the country than me, and neither of us really had any money to spend and go visit each other. On top of that I was 18 and still living with my parents and I wasn’t out to them yet, so asking them for help was a total no go. The other members of the Holy Trinity Community started a Go Fund Me campaign for us, and raised $1200 for us to have a vacation and meet in person finally. I flew out to Alberta and met with her, and my whole life changed. I live there now with her, I moved out with her six months after that trip. On top of all of that, I have since come out to my family, who are pretty supportive now, but the process was really rough, and the members of the Holy Trinity community were totally there for me and my girlfriend. <br><em>(Participant 002)</em></p>

    <h2>Chapter 4. Findings from Study 1: Ethnographic Analysis</h2>
    
    <p><h3>Field Site and YouTube Personalities</h3>
    This study focuses on the Holy Trinity community on YouTube, comprised of three prominent YouTubers: Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart. Each has built a significant following through distinctive content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grace Helbig</strong>: Known for her humorous vlogs and performance-based videos, she left My Damn Channel to gain creative control, which she announces in her popular video, "Welcome to It'sGrace".</li>
        <li><strong>Hannah Hart</strong>: Gained fame with her series "My Drunk Kitchen," where she cooks while intoxicated. She also promotes charity work through her "Have a Hart" day organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Mamrie Hart</strong>: Creates comedic mixology videos featuring pop culture references and sexual innuendo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Emergent Themes</h3>
    <p><h4>Community Support</h4><br>
    The Holy Trinity community demonstrates strong support among its members. In "Welcome to It'sGrace," Grace expresses gratitude for the community's support during her transition to a new channel, highlighting the collaborative nature of YouTube. In "6 S'More Days," viewers and fellow YouTubers help Hannah Hart reach one million subscribers, illustrating the value placed on mutual support within the community.</p>

    <p><h4>Authenticity</h4><br>
    Authenticity is a key theme, where YouTubers often share genuine emotions and leave in mistakes, creating a sense of realness. For example, Grace Helbig’s videos frequently include unedited speech errors and candid moments. Videos like "Grace and Mamrie Answer Your Questions" and "REVIEWING TROYE SIVAN'S HAPPY LITTLE PILL" show the trio engaging in unscripted, candid conversations, further emphasizing authenticity.</p>

    <p><h4>Profanity and Sexual Language</h4><br>
    The use of profanity and sexually explicit language is common, serving as a form of self-expression and breaking social norms. This is seen as part of the YouTubers' authentic selves, making their content relatable and engaging.</p>

    <p><h4>Self-Reflection and Criticism</h4><br>
    Self-reflection is frequently demonstrated through self-deprecating humor and critical comments about their appearance or content. This adds to the authenticity and relatability of their videos. The YouTubers often discuss their own processes and the challenges of creating content, inviting viewers into their creative journey.</p>

        <p><h4>Motivations for Creating Videos</h4>
        Participants cited self-expression and socialization as primary reasons for creating videos. They appreciate the platform for allowing them to express their creativity and connect with others. Many participants felt YouTube was a safe space to share their thoughts without fear of judgment from close friends or family.</p>

        <p><h4>Audience Perception</h4>
        Initially, many participants envisioned their audience as a single person or a close friend to ease the anxiety of speaking to an unknown audience. Over time, they developed their own "voice" and became more comfortable with their audience.</p>

        <p><h4>Community and Social Norms</h4>
        All participants viewed the Holy Trinity fandom as a community, noting values of kindness, authenticity, and self-acceptance. The community is seen as supportive and inclusive, with a focus on being genuine and not taking oneself too seriously.</p>

        <p><h4>Pressure to Create Content</h4>
        Some participants felt pressure to create content, especially as their subscriber count grew. This pressure was linked to a sense of responsibility to their audience and the desire to maintain engagement.</p>

        <p><h3>Content Analysis Results</h3>
        Descriptive statistics were calculated for the thematic categories, activity settings, and the 17 cultural values from the Kasser and Ryan Aspiration Index (Kasser & Ryan, 1996), for all 60 videos. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa and was found to have strong reliability (between .821-1.00) for all three coding schemes.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5. Study 2 Methods</h2>
            <p>Study 2 complements the qualitative findings with a quantitative survey of 135 emerging adults from the YouTube community. Participants, recruited through social media, completed a 115-item questionnaire measuring ethnic identity, global identity, online identity, sense of community on YouTube, YouTube presence, cultural values, parasocial attachment, and demographics. Data collection spanned six weeks using Qualtrics.com. The survey aimed to examine the relationships between online presence, identity, and cultural values, providing a comprehensive understanding of how participation in the YouTube community influences identity formation.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6. Study 2 Quantitative Analysis Findings</h2>

    <p><h3>General Findings</h3>
    The data were examined for missing values and indices of normality, with a logarithmic transformation applied to skewed variables. No significant gender or ethnic group differences were found. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alphas, showing good to excellent internal reliability across measures and ethnic categories.</p>

    <p><h3>Online Presence and Sense of Community</h3>
    Pearson’s r correlations showed that days per week (r = .310, p = .005), videos watched per day (r = .249, p = .025), number of subscribers (r = .266, p = .043), and number of views (r = .255, p = .022) were all related to sense of community.</p>
    
    <p>Multiple regression analysis showed that days per week on YouTube was significantly associated with sense of community (β = .236, p = .033), explaining 13.6% of the variance (R2 = .136).</p>

    <p><h3>Motivations and Cultural Value Endorsement</h3>
    Correlations revealed that endorsement of success and fame as motivations for participating in YouTube were related (r = .550, p < .001), but no significant relationships were found among motivations and cultural values endorsed.</p>

    <p><h3>Participation and Identity</h3>
    Days per week on YouTube (r = .250, p = .024) and videos per day (r = .235, p = .034) were correlated with online identity, but no other significant relationships were found. Multiple regression confirmed that days per week on YouTube was significantly associated with online identity (β = .250, p = .024), explaining 7.3% of the variance (R2 = .073).</p>

    <p><h3>Parasocial Attachment and Identity</h3>
    Parasocial attachment was significantly correlated with sense of community (r = .409, p < .001), online identity (r = .368, p = .001), and endorsement of personal needs and desires (r = .233, p = .046). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that parasocial attachment mediated the relationship between online presence and both sense of community and online identity.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 7. Discussion</h2>
    <div>
    <p><h4>Research Question 1: Cultural Values and Practices in a YouTube Community</h4>
    The ethnographic study revealed four main themes in the Holy Trinity community on YouTube: community support, authenticity, self-reflection, and self-deprecating humor. The community support theme highlighted a spirit of camaraderie, where YouTubers promote each other's projects and help achieve goals without seeking personal gain. This is echoed by viewers who actively protect and support the YouTubers' projects.</p>
    <p>Authenticity was a critical value, as viewers valued the genuine nature of the content, leading to deeper connections and stronger parasocial relationships. This authenticity transcended the online world, with participants applying advice from YouTubers in their offline lives.</p>
    <p>Self-reflection was essential for participants, who had to reconcile their self-image with potential judgments from viewers. This process facilitated identity formation, balancing autonomy and community.</p>
    <p>Self-deprecating humor, tied to self-acceptance, allowed participants to address their flaws humorously, mitigating negative self-evaluations while fostering authenticity. The use of profanity and sexual language underscored the value of self-expression and normalization of taboo topics.</p>

    <p><h4>Research Question 2: Online Presence and Sense of Community</h4>
    Increased online presence on YouTube was associated with a stronger sense of community, but this relationship was mediated by parasocial attachment. This suggests that the depth of connection participants feel with YouTubers enhances their sense of belonging.</p>

    <p><h4>Research Question 3: Value Endorsement and Motivation</h4>
    Participants endorsed both individualistic and collectivistic values without significant preference for either. Health, an intrinsic value, was highly endorsed, while spirituality, an extrinsic value, was least endorsed. This suggests that online communities may foster a blend of intrinsic and extrinsic values, differing from offline cultural experiences.</p>

    <p><h4>Research Question 4: Participation and Identity</h4>
    Higher online identity scores were linked to greater participation on YouTube. However, this relationship was mediated by parasocial attachment, indicating that the sense of identity within the YouTube community is influenced by the strength of parasocial relationships.</p>

    <p><h4>Research Question 5: Parasocial Attachment and Online Behavior</h4>
    Parasocial attachment was significantly associated with a sense of community and online identity, but not with fame motivation or ethnic/global identity. This highlights the role of parasocial relationships in shaping online experiences and identities.</p>

    <p><h4>Research Limitations</h4>
    The ethnographic nature of this study introduces potential biases, and the homogeneity of cultural backgrounds among participants limits generalizability. The findings may not apply to more diverse online communities, suggesting a need for further research in varied cultural contexts.</p>

    <p><h4>Future Directions</h4>
    Future research should explore the relationship between parasocial attachment and identity formation, the synthesis of value systems online, and the experiences of more ethnically and culturally diverse online communities. Investigating the implications of online community participation on well-being and the dynamics of intrinsic versus extrinsic values could provide valuable insights.</p>

    <p><h4>Implications</h4>
    How identity is formed not only influences the individual and their social networks, but also works to shape the overall cultural practices and values as time goes on. Understanding how these values shape our behavior has important implications for understanding multicultural experiences, and even how one’s sense of cultural identity is navigated under different circumstances.</p>
    <p>In several survey and interview responses, participants noted the use of YouTube to reduce social anxieties or even depression. Michael Wesch (2008) has explained that many feel a reduced sense of fear, as context online is less tangible; we are able to watch others on YouTube, comment, connect, and experience relationships and emotions without being completely vulnerable as we might be in face-to-face interaction. Understanding how cultural values shape online spaces and how online spaces shape cultural values and social interactions may prove useful in treatment and research of anxiety disorders, especially in adolescents and emerging adults.</p>
    <p>The primary theme gathered from these research findings suggest that a major goal in joining YouTube, and a major practice valued, is that of participating as a community. This sense of community online is typically associated with a greater sense of happiness and sense of wellbeing (Davidson & Cotter, 1991). The mere act of expression one’s self in something even as private as a journal or diary can have positive effects on mental and emotional wellness. In a culture in which emerging adults today are constantly inundated not only with new technology daily, but with negative evaluations and labels from pop culture and media regarding their use of technology, often being hailed as “narcissistic and self-involved Millennials”, future research may find that such social media is actual a protective factor in the well-being of emerging adults and adolescents. These protective factors may also be bolstered by an integration of individualistic and communitarian values, utilizing the drives from one side of the spectrum to create opportunities to foster values from the other.</p>

    <p><h4>Conclusion</h4>
    Today's emerging adults, Millennials, and digital natives have grown up in a world shaped by digital technologies which influence communication in all aspects of everyday life. This study aimed to collect rich, descriptive data regarding the cultural themes and practices among emerging adults within the online social space on YouTube, shedding light on the implications for identity development among this population.</p>
    <p>Greenfield’s (2009) theory of social change and human development predicts a shift toward more individualistic values and fewer communitarian values with the increase in globalized interactions. However, the findings of this study suggest that YouTube may be a culture centered on community values, promoting interpersonal connection. This community is relatively homogenous in several ways, including age, socioeconomic status, and Western cultural influences.</p>
    <p>The evidence from this study aligns with Arnett, Ramos, and Jensen’s (2001) description of identity development goals, where individuals seek a balance between autonomy and community. The Holy Trinity community exemplifies this negotiation, as individuals express their individuality while valuing and fostering communitarian principles.</p>
    <p>While individualistic cultural values are often endorsed, so too are collectivistic values, indicating that through individualized practices, communitarian values are sought. The value of focusing on one's own needs and desires was linked to parasocial attachment, which was significantly associated with participants' sense of community on YouTube and online identity. This suggests that individuals may seek connection and attachment through YouTube, enhancing their sense of community and identity.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the findings reveal that emerging adults use online platforms like YouTube to shape and express their identities, balancing individualistic and communitarian values. While the community studied is not entirely generalizable due to its homogeneity, it offers valuable insights into the interplay between online environments and identity formation. Future research should explore more diverse online communities and investigate the broader implications of online participation on identity and well-being.</p>
